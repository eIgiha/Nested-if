# Conditional Statements in Python

This repository demonstrates the use of conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, and `else`) in Python. The code provides examples of how to compare two variables (`x` and `y`) and execute different blocks of code based on their values.

## Code Explanation

The code includes:
- **Nested `if` statements**: Demonstrates how to use nested conditions to compare variables.
- **`elif` statements**: Shows a more concise way to handle multiple conditions.
- **`else` statements**: Explains how to handle cases where none of the conditions are met.

### Key Points:
- The `elif` statement is used to check additional conditions if the previous ones are not true.
- The `else` statement is optional and is executed only if none of the preceding conditions are true.
- You can have multiple `elif` statements but only one `else` statement.

## Example Output

For the given values:
